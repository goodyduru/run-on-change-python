## Run on Change Python
This project demonstrates reloading the entire project if any of its files changes. This is what happens with Django and Flask projects.  

Inspiration for this came from the [werkzeug](https://github.com/pallets/werkzeug/) project. I reimplemented it using their code as a guide.
